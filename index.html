                    <p>Overall, our team worked effectively together and completed all of the allocated tasks with great quality. We communicated mostly through Messenger and Canvas, with a face-to-face meeting once a week to discuss the project, report, and review our work. Even though we experienced some issues with one of our teammates at first, we were able to complete our assignment. Fortunately, each member of the group respects one another and is eager to put in their all for this project. They also recommended some great suggestions to improve our project so that we could complete it without difficulty. Our team also makes make sure jobs are assigned fairly so that each member of the group contributes equally. This adventure with my team is quite enjoyable for me.</p>

                    <p>Having teammates in the same tutorial group is the biggest advantage for us. Despite the fact that we still have online lectures, offline tutorial lessons are the best way to meet and hold our weekly meetings. Before meeting each other, we had already talked through our Facebook Messenger group chat. Luckily, all of us were comfortable among each other so there was no awkwardness. Another helpful that we used during our project was the Groups section on Canvas. We used this section to upload every summary of our meetings, the tasks, the deadlines, and meeting notes. This helps us to keep track of the time we have left and the current process of our project. Even though our early process had a teammate problem, we managed to figure everything out together and had come to a decision where our team would just consist of 4 members. Remarkably, we weren’t rushed by our deadlines since we started working on it so early. We divided our tasks equally and fairly based on our skills and strengths. In conclusion, I believe we did a splendid job and we deserve a score worth our hard work.</p>

                    <h4>Tran Phuc Khang</h4>
                    <p>As a freshman, I was feeling a bit nervous when it came to working as a group since it is my first time doing so in a university environment. However, my teammates are really talented, cooperative, and supportive which I’m grateful for. They always offer me help and suggestions whenever a problem comes up in the way so that I can complete my tasks effortlessly. Unfortunately, our team had a problem reaching out to one of the members. After giving them some time and not getting any responses, our leaders had to make a decision which is to report them to the lecturer. As a result, that person is now no longer working with us. Except for that issue, the four of us have been doing our jobs, supporting each other and working as a team smoothly and efficiently for five weeks now.</p>

                    <p>First of all, our group has been working together for more than 4 weeks. It seems like until now we have not had any problems. Everybody is working on their part really well. However, at the beginning, there was an issue with a member who was not responding, but then our group solved it smoothly. Everyone in the group is kind, respectful, and ready to help each other. Due to the fact that we combine between online and offline, I think it is really convenient for discussing and sharing ideas. We're almost finished with our project. I'm hoping it'll turn out fantastic after we're done.</p>
