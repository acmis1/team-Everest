                    <h5>s3995223</h5>
                    <p>As a 22-year-old, Vinh has been through multiple living environments
                        (Vinh Phuc - his hometown, Hanoi, the UK, Ho Chi Minh city). These
                        adversities have made him a persistent individual whose hobby is 
                        to always strive to explore via new experiences. His exposure to 
                        business leaders during high-school extracurricular experience helped him realize the role of technology in the
                        upscaling of a business and in advancing one's career. While having
                        no direct experience in IT, Vinh's academic and professional work
                        as a marketing-major has involved high level of digital expertise and
                        technological knowledge

                        the UK, majoring in Computer Science. His interest in IT sparked
                        since he was a child, from observing and watching technological
                        advancement on TV, movies and news report. This curiosity has
                        driven him to dig deeper into the field of IT, specifically in
                        cybersecurity. While having limited professional experience, An has
                        famaliarised himself with the topic of cyber attacks, by selfstudying
                         from Hacksplaining. Like most of his IT peers, An dedicate
                        most of his time on the PC, even his hobby is spent with the
                        computer for video games

                        major. When he was young, his passion in coding was already
                        formed as he started by writing down simple lines of code for basic
                        game. Growing up realizing the lucrativeness of IT, and after
                        multiple academic "trials", Khang arrived at the decision to pursue a
                        professional path in IT, He is currently on his path to expand his
                        skillset in front-end web design using CSS and Java.

                        build a snake game. This experience has intrigued him to choose IT
                        as his future career. Beside spending his free time playing game, he
                        also participated in debate activities, which is a unique asset to an
