                    <p>As a 22-year-old, Vinh has been through multiple living environments
                        (Vinh Phuc - his hometown, Hanoi, the UK, Ho Chi Minh city). These
                        adversities have made him a persistent individual whose hobby is 
                        to always strive to explore via new experiences. His exposure to 
                        business leaders during high-school extracurricular experience helped him realize the role of technology in the
                        upscaling of a business and in advancing one's career. While having
                        no direct experience in IT, Vinh's academic and professional work
                        as a marketing-major has involved high level of digital expertise and
                        technological knowledge

                    <p>Before stuyding in RMIT as an IT-major, An was a senior student in
                        the UK, majoring in Computer Science. His interest in IT sparked
                        since he was a child, from observing and watching technological
                        advancement on TV, movies and news report. This curiosity has
                        driven him to dig deeper into the field of IT, specifically in
                        cybersecurity. While having limited professional experience, An has
                        famaliarised himself with the topic of cyber attacks, by selfstudying
                         from Hacksplaining. Like most of his IT peers, An dedicate
                        most of his time on the PC, even his hobby is spent with the
                        computer for video games

                    <h5>s3995223</h5>
                    <p>Khang has had a diverse educational background, from studying in
                        Whangaparaoa College in New Zealand, pursuing the major of
                        International Business in RMIT for a year before switching to IT
                        major. When he was young, his passion in coding was already
                        formed as he started by writing down simple lines of code for basic
                        game. Growing up realizing the lucrativeness of IT, and after
                        multiple academic "trials", Khang arrived at the decision to pursue a
                        professional path in IT, He is currently on his path to expand his
                        skillset in front-end web design using CSS and Java.

                        where he was actually a chemistry-specialized student. Surrounded
                        by friends with similar interests in Technology, he and his peers
                        have worked on various projects in C++, including a program to
                        build a snake game. This experience has intrigued him to choose IT
                        as his future career. Beside spending his free time playing game, he
                        also participated in debate activities, which is a unique asset to an

                    <p>Overall, our team worked effectively together and completed all of the allocated tasks with great quality. We communicated mostly through Messenger and Canvas, with a face-to-face meeting once a week to discuss the project, report, and review our work. Even though we experienced some issues with one of our teammates at first, we were able to complete our assignment. Fortunately, each member of the group respects one another and is eager to put in their all for this project. They also recommended some great suggestions to improve our project so that we could complete it without difficulty. Our team also makes make sure jobs are assigned fairly so that each member of the group contributes equally. This adventure with my team is quite enjoyable for me.</p>

                    <p>Having teammates in the same tutorial group is the biggest advantage for us. Despite the fact that we still have online lectures, offline tutorial lessons are the best way to meet and hold our weekly meetings. Before meeting each other, we had already talked through our Facebook Messenger group chat. Luckily, all of us were comfortable among each other so there was no awkwardness. Another helpful that we used during our project was the Groups section on Canvas. We used this section to upload every summary of our meetings, the tasks, the deadlines, and meeting notes. This helps us to keep track of the time we have left and the current process of our project. Even though our early process had a teammate problem, we managed to figure everything out together and had come to a decision where our team would just consist of 4 members. Remarkably, we weren’t rushed by our deadlines since we started working on it so early. We divided our tasks equally and fairly based on our skills and strengths. In conclusion, I believe we did a splendid job and we deserve a score worth our hard work.</p>

                    <p>As a freshman, I was feeling a bit nervous when it came to working as a group since it is my first time doing so in a university environment. However, my teammates are really talented, cooperative, and supportive which I’m grateful for. They always offer me help and suggestions whenever a problem comes up in the way so that I can complete my tasks effortlessly. Unfortunately, our team had a problem reaching out to one of the members. After giving them some time and not getting any responses, our leaders had to make a decision which is to report them to the lecturer. As a result, that person is now no longer working with us. Except for that issue, the four of us have been doing our jobs, supporting each other and working as a team smoothly and efficiently for five weeks now.</p>

                    <p>First of all, our group has been working together for more than 4 weeks. It seems like until now we have not had any problems. Everybody is working on their part really well. However, at the beginning, there was an issue with a member who was not responding, but then our group solved it smoothly. Everyone in the group is kind, respectful, and ready to help each other. Due to the fact that we combine between online and offline, I think it is really convenient for discussing and sharing ideas. We're almost finished with our project. I'm hoping it'll turn out fantastic after we're done.</p>
